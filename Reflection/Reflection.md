### Lanaguage(s) Selected and rationale for selection

I chose Java for Reporting and Math Calculation because Iâ€™m familiar with Java, and I believe I did a similar lab work before with CSV files in Java, and Math Calculations are just easy. And I pick Python for Web Development because it is simple for Python to make a request to an API.

### What about language made it easy?

As I mentioned previously, I did a similar lab work with CSV files, so I  read the code and changed some lines for Reporting, in order to print out artists and their streams. For math calculations, it just simple codes I believe. For web development, I find it easy for python to write a request to any API by reading [Python API Tutorial: Getting Started with APIs](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-api-tutorial/)

### What about the language made it difficult?

The most difficult part for me is the formula for the math calculations, the numbers were not the same from Fahrenheit to Celsius and Celsius back to Fahrenheit. Later, I find out I wrote some unnecessary parentheses in the formula.
